# Intelligent Cloud Infrastructure Review with GenAI Assistance

## Project Overview
This project focuses on reviewing cloud infrastructure configurations to identify
security risks, inefficiencies, and optimization opportunities using GenAI-assisted analysis.

## Problem Statement
IT leadership requires better visibility into cloud usage, security risks, and
operational inefficiencies. Full automation is out of scope, so GenAI is used only
to assist in analysis and recommendations.

## Scope
- Cloud Infrastructure Review (AWS – conceptual)
- Security risk identification
- Cost and performance optimization
- GenAI-assisted insights (advisory only)

## Methodology
- Reviewed sample cloud configuration files
- Identified misconfigurations and risks
- Used GenAI to summarize findings and suggest improvements
- Documented recommendations in a technical report

## Deliverables
- Security risk analysis
- Optimization recommendations
- Cloud architecture diagram
- Final technical review report (PDF)

## Tools Used
- AWS (conceptual architecture)
- Docker (conceptual)
- GitHub
- GenAI (analysis support only)
